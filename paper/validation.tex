\section{Validation}
\label{sec:validation}
The described model has been validated using a discrete event simulator. Each simulation experiment was run unitl the network reaches it's steady state where further networy cycles do not change the collected statistics appreciably. 

Numerous validation experiments were performed for several combinations of network sizes, service lengths, number and probability of selection, filtering VNFs and $p_{user\_sdn}$. To remain concise, latency results are presented for the following cases only:
