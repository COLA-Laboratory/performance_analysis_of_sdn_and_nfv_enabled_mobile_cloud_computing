\begin{abstract}
Despite demand for more intelligent mobile applications and services, progress has been held back by the physical limitations of mobile hardware. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is regarded as a promising method to extend the battery life, increase the data storage and enhance the processing power of mobile devices. To provide these enhancements cost efficiently, MCC exploits Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) to simplify the network management and accelerate mobile service innovations. Analytical models provide a fast and cost-effective approach to experiment with these new technologies. Although some interesting research findings have appeared in the literature regarding the performance of SDN and NFV in MCC, most work only considers these technologies in isolation and cannot capture their cooperative and complementary relations in practical deployments. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of future MCC, a comprehensive analytical model is developed in this work to investigate the performance of MCC in the presence of multiple NFV service chains and a virtualised SDN network. The end-to-end latency is derived based on the developed model with different network scales. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed analytical model accurately matches the transmission latency produced by simulation experiments.
