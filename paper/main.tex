\begin{abstract}
Consumer demand for better and faster online services requires datacentres to continually evolve to provide more powerful and flexible storage, processing and networking services. Software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualisation (NFV) have been regarded as two key pillars for building next generation data centres. Analytical models provide a fast and cost effective approach to experiment with these new technologies. Although some interesting research findings have appeared in the literature regarding the performance of SDN and NFV in the datacentre, most work only considers these technologies in isolation which hardly reflects their practical deployment and cannot capture interaction effects between these two technologies. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of next generation datacentre networks, a comprehensive analytical model is developed in this work to investigate the performance of a datacentre network in the presence of multiple NFV service chains and a virtualised SDN implementation. The end-to-end latency is derived based on the developed model with different network parameters. Finally the accuracy of the proposed analytical model is validated by conducting comprehensive simulation experiments.
