Based on the general working mechanism of SDN and NFV technologies \cite{FarrisTKS19}, a network architecture is abstracted in this study as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:network_topology}, where multiple NFV chains are deployed and linked by a virtualised SDN implementation. With NFV deployment, a MCC service is provided in the form of a service chain which is formed by several VNFs. The packets of MCC devices pass through each of the VNFs in sequence.  In the abstracted network architecture, multiple NFV chains can coexist and different NFV service chains have different numbers of VNFs, each of which has different packet processing capability.

When a MCC service is launched in the cloud datacenter, the cloud management orchestrator or manager analyses the performance and functional requirements, and initiate VNFs in the underlying virtualised server. Once the VNFs are deployed, the cloud management orchestrator coupled with SDN controller link the individual VNFs to form an NFV service chain to provide MCC service for end devices. During this process, SDN controller is responsible for configuring the routing table of the underlying network switches, collecting the related service parameters, and sending the collected data to cloud management orchestrator for service optimisation. Each SDN enabled switch has a flow table containing instructions on how to route the received packets. Due to the physical storage limitation, it is impossible to store the instructions for all possible destinations. Therefore, once the local switch receives a packet that doesnot match routing table, a request will be sent from switch to the controller to consult on how to process the received package. After a series of computation, SDN controller responses this request for further process. Within the abstracted network architecture, we consider an SDN architecture where only the virtual switches connect to the SDN controller. This architecture is representative of those used in industry, most notably a comparable architecture is used in VMWare's NSX solution \cite{VMW18}.

According to \cite{Cisco18}, the network topology that supports the communication among different architecture components, e.g. VNFs and SND controller, is mainly based on a fat-tree structure, which is formed by three layers of switches: core, aggregation and edge switches. In most modern datacenters, the switches at the edge layer are connected to Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, and the VNFs are hosted in VMs or containers on servers on these racks. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:network_topology}, the fat-tree topology is defined by the number of ports at each switch. Let $k$ denote the number of ports for each physical switch and $k_{v}$ be the number of ports for each virtual switch. Each core switch connects to one aggregation switch of each of $k$ pods. Within each pod, a layer of aggregation switches is fully connected to a layer of edge switches. In addition, each edge switch is connected to $k/2$ servers. Each server contains a virtual switch connected to $k_{v}$ VNFs. In total, a three layer $k$ port fat-tree topology has $(k/2)^2$ core switches, $k$ pods, $k^2/2$ aggregation switches, $k^2/2$ edge switches, $k^3/4$ virtual switches, and $(k^3/4) \cdot k_{v}$ VNFs.
