When a MCC service is instantiated in the cloud datacenter, the cloud management system analyses the performance and functional requirements of the service, and initiates VNFs on VMs or containers. Once the VNFs are deployed, the cloud management system and the SDN controller link the individual VNFs to form an NFV service chain to provide the MCC service to end devices. Each SDN enabled switch has a flow table containing instructions on how to route the received packets. In this work we assume that due to physical storage limitations, it is impossible to store the instructions for all possible destinations. Therefore, once the local switch receives a packet that does not match any entry in its routing table, a request will be sent from the switch to the controller for instructions on how to process the received package.

Using Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), a MCC service is provided by defining a service chain consisting of several VNFs (Virtual Network Functions). Packets for that service are routed through each of the VNFs in sequence. Multiple service chains can coexist and different service chains can have different numbers of VNFs.

Based on the mechanisms of SDN and NFV \cite{FarrisTKS19}, the SDN enabled fat-tree networking topology shown in Fig. \ref{fig:network_topology} is considered. The fat-tree network topology is formed from three layers of switches: core, aggregation and edge switches. In most modern datacenters, the switches at the edge layer are connected to Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, and the VNFs are hosted in VMs or containers on servers on these racks. In this work we consider an SDN architecture where only the virtual switches connect to the SDN controller. This architecture is representative of those used in industry, most notably a comparable architecture is used in VMWare's NSX solution \cite{VMW18}. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:network_topology}, the fat-tree topology is defined by the number of ports at each switch. Let $k$ denote the number of ports for each physical switch and $k_{v}$ be the number of ports for each virtual switch. Each core switch connects to one aggregation switch of each of $k$ pods. Within each pod, a layer of aggregation switches is fully connected to a layer of edge switches. In addition, each edge switch is connected to $k/2$ servers. Each server contains a virtual switch connected to $k_{v}$ VNFs. In total, a three layer $k$ port fat-tree topology has $(k/2)^2$ core switches, $k$ pods, $k^2/2$ aggregation switches, $k^2/2$ edge switches, $k^3/4$ virtual switches, and $(k^3/4) \cdot k_{v}$ VNFs.
