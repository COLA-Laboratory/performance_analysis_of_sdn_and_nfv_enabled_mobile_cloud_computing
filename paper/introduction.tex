\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


The key contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item SDN
\item Network Function Virtualisation
\item Multiple Services
\item Different Length Services
\item Reducing Traffic

\end{itemize}


The rest of this paper is organised as follows. \pref{sec:preliminaries} reviews the preliminaries that are useful for understanding the subsequent sections. In \pref{sec:analytical_model} we derive the analytical model. \pref{sec:validation} validates this model with extensive simulation experiments. Finally \pref{sec:conclusions} concludes the paper, explores the implications of the models and examines future research directions.
