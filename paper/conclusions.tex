Emerging services will place intense demand on the datacentre. To provide a good service whilst remaining economically viable, modern datacentres are exploring the potential of SDN and NFV to provide efficient allocation of resources and simplify management. Whilst these are often considered complementary technologies, previous analytical models in the literature have typically considered them in isolation. Further previous work on this topic has not considered the importance of the interconnection network or how multiple services with different length service chains may affect performance.

In this paper we have presented a comprehensive analytical model capable of modelling an SDN and NFV enabled datacentre. Extensions are derived that accurately model how the presence of multiple services with varying length service chains impacts the datacentre. The resulting comprehensive model provides insight into the interactions between SDN and NFV that can be applied in the planning and design of  datacentres.
