\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
% Outline paper again

Whilst this work has evaluated a specific network structure, the same approach for determining the impact of integrating SDN and NFV should be transferable to other network topologies. 

% Future Work
In future work:

- Examine effect of particular placement
- Extend work to encompass NFs that increase the load on the network.
- MM1 queues have been shown to be innaccurate for real world communications networks. Extending the model to consider the impact of bursty traffic is also important.
